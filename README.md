# Calculator App

## Overview

The Calculator App is a simple yet functional web-based calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates how to create an interactive user interface and handle user input for performing mathematical calculations. 

The application provides a user-friendly experience with clear visual feedback and error handling, making it suitable for both basic and complex calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages in red when invalid operations (e.g., division by zero) are attempted.
- **User Feedback**: Provides visual feedback on button clicks and shows active states for a better user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the calculator looks good on various screen sizes.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the calculator layout.
- **style.css**: The stylesheet for styling the calculator, including the layout, buttons, and display area.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file containing the logic for handling user input, performing calculations, and managing errors.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd calculator-app
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` File**

   You can open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser by double-clicking on it or using the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

### Usage

1. **Basic Operations**

   - Click on the numbers and operators to build a mathematical expression.
   - Press `=` to calculate the result.
   - Press `C` to clear the current input and reset the display.

2. **Error Handling**

   - If an invalid operation is attempted (e.g., division by zero), the display will show "Error" in red.
   - Ensure that inputs are valid and follow the standard arithmetic syntax.

## Code Explanation

### HTML (index.html)

The HTML file sets up the structure of the calculator, including:
- A display area for showing the current input and results.
- A grid of buttons for numbers and operators.

### CSS (style.css)

The CSS file provides styling for:
- The calculator layout, including button sizes and display area.
- Visual feedback for button interactions (hover and active states).
- Error message styling to ensure errors are displayed in red.

### JavaScript (script.js)

The JavaScript file contains:
- Event listeners for handling button clicks and updating the display.
- Logic for evaluating mathematical expressions and handling errors.
- Function to parse and compute the input expression safely.

## Example

Here's a quick example of how the calculator works:

1. Input `5 + 3 * 2`.
2. Click `=` to get the result, which will be `11`.
3. If you attempt `5 / 0`, the display will show `Error` in red.
